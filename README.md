# Cursive-Script-Bot
Telegram bot to convert regular text to cursive

This bot converts all latin alphabet characters (A-Z,a-z) to the corresponding Unicode cursive symbols.

To use this bot, you can either chat with it directly (At t.me/cursivetextbot), or by typing @cursivetextbot in any chat!

This bot supports 2 modes:

- Normal chat mode (the bot effectively acts as a parrot that replies anything you send it back in cursive form

- Inline query mode (for direct translation of text within a chat, without needing to leave the chat)
